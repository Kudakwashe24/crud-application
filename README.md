# crud-application
CRUD is also a term frequently used in the design of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience), as many web applications' main functionality involves these four basic functions.

JSON is a data format that consists of key-value pairs in the form of strings. The name/value pairs are separated by a colon and each pair is separated by a comma.
# Getting Started:

- Created my index.html file
- created my ReadMe.md fie

## npm install express-generator -g
* This is the first command that I ran:

- It creates an environment where the server is made.
- Generic Responses are set, in which form their is need.
- Routing Generic need to set.
- Logging where there is a need.


## express --view=ejs
* This is the second commmand that I use and the following was created:

- bin: / www
- public: / images, javascripts and stylesheets
- routes: / index.js and users.js
- views: / error.js and index.js
- app.js
- package.json

## npm install -g json-server
- creates a db.json file with some data

## json-server --watch db.json
- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to db.json.
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output.
- Id values are not mutable. Any id value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will    be respected, but only if not already taken.

## npm install
- With this command you'll be creating a node_modules folder which contains all the neccessary modules

## npm install nodemon --save
- nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the    directory are detected.
